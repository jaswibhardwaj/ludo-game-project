## Ludo Game App - HTML, CSS, JavaScript

This repository contains the code for a simple Ludo game implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game allows two players to compete against each other, rolling dice and moving their pieces around the board to reach the finish line.

### Project Structure

```
├── Ludo.js
├── constants.js
├── style.css
└── index.html
```

### Technologies Used

* **HTML:** Provides the structure of the game interface, including the game board, dice, player tokens, and buttons.
* **CSS:** Styles the game elements, including the board colors, token colors, and overall layout.
* **JavaScript:** Handles the game logic, including:
    * Dice rolling
    * Player turn management
    * Token movement
    * Winning conditions
    * User interaction

### Functionality

1. **Game Setup:**
   - Two players are selected.
   - Each player has four tokens.
   - The game board is displayed.

2. **Game Play:**
   - Players take turns rolling the dice.
   - The dice roll determines how many spaces the player can move their token.
   - Players can choose which token to move.
   - Players must land on the starting point of their color to bring a token into play.
   - Players can capture opponent's tokens by landing on their space.
   - Players can "kill" their own tokens if they land on their own space.

3. **Winning Condition:**
   - The first player to move all four tokens to the finish line wins the game.

4. **User Interface:**
   - The game board is interactive, allowing players to click on their tokens to move them.
   - The dice is displayed and animated when rolled.
   - The current player's turn is highlighted.
   - A message area displays game updates, such as the dice roll result, the current player's turn, and the winning player.

### Key Files:

* **index.html:** Contains the HTML structure for the game, including the game board, dice, and player information.
* **style.css:** Provides the CSS styles for the game elements, including the board layout, token colors, and visual effects.
* **Ludo.js:** Implements the core game logic, including dice rolling, turn management, token movement, and winning conditions.
* **constants.js:** Holds global constants and configurations for the game, such as board dimensions, player colors, and game rules.

### How to Run the Game:

1. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
2. The game will automatically load and you can start playing by clicking on the dice and then selecting a token to move.

### Future Improvements:

* **Multiplayer:** Implement functionality for online or local multiplayer.
* **AI Opponent:** Add an AI opponent for single-player mode.
* **Sound Effects:** Include sound effects for rolling the dice and moving tokens.
* **Animations:** Enhance the visual appeal of the game with more animations and transitions.

This project is a good starting point for building a more complex and engaging Ludo game. Feel free to modify and enhance the code to create your own version!
